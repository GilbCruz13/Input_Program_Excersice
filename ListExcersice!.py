#Take a list, say for example this one:
# a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
#and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.



a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

for x in a:
    if x < 6:
        print(x)

#For loop and created an if statement, that prints all that numbers on the list that are less than 6
# Output : 1,1,2,3,5
